### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It is the one and only Davonsu!!!
I would love to say I know what I am doing, but I do not lmao.
My pronouns are He/Him.
I am looking for my go-to techie buddy who will be there during those late nights to help make custom programs.
Fun fact: I can turn any fictional character into a thoroughly flushed personality within an established universe. 
I will not lie; C++ does not seem helpful; however, this is due to the lack of real-world examples showcased during the second semester. 
I am BLUNT. Please do not come to me expecting to sugarcoat.
